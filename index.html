            When Mother Nature is in a bad mood (which is more likely than ever these days thanks to climate change), 
            it helps to keep an eye on what's happening in the sky. One of the most important tools for that is a mobile 
            weather app. A good weather app helps you decide if you'll need to bring an umbrella to work, or prepare for 
            more serious conditions. With wild weather across the country, particularly hurricanes threatening coastal 
            states, it's a good idea to check the forecast or radar for upcoming conditions. A weather app lets you do
            that wherever you are, whenever you like.

          <p>
            Yogurt is a fermented milk product and as such is a means of preserving the nutrients in milk. A wide 
            variety of yogurts are now available around the world, ranging from very-low-fat fruit yogurts to 
            Greek-style yogurt with a fat content around 8 g per 100 g. Yogurt can be made from cows', ewes', goats',
             or buffalo's milk. Since yogurt is derived from milk, it provides protein, calcium, and other minerals, and a range of
            vitamins. Levels of some vitamins, such as vitamin B1 and pantothenic acid, are reduced as they are utilized
             by the bacterial culture used to produce the yogurt.
